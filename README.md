# Layoffs-Data-Analysis-with-SQL

## Project Overview
This project involves data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a layoffs dataset. The objective is to prepare the data for analysis and gain insights into layoffs trends and patterns.

## Technologies Used
- SQL (MySQL)

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about layoffs, including company name, location, industry, total laid-off employees, percentage laid off, date, stage, country, and funds raised in millions.

4. **Remove Unnecessary Columns**: Dropped columns that were not needed for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyzed trends in layoffs over time.
- Examined total layoffs by company, industry, and country.
- Identified top companies with the highest layoffs.

## Conclusion

This project shows how to clean and analyze layoffs data using SQL. By preparing the data and exploring trends, we can gain insights into layoffs and their impact on companies. It highlights the importance of data cleaning and analysis in understanding workforce changes.
